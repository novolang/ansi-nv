#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/alloc_scan.sh — nothing in `vtcore` allocates, as a check that
# can fail.
#
# `vtcore` is the module a device runs.  What makes it usable there is
# not that it avoids `Str` and lists, which the type checker decides,
# but that it puts nothing on the heap.  Nothing in the language
# enforces that, and the emitted LLVM is where it is true or false, so
# this reads it.
#
# There are three runs, because a check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
#   1. Every function in `vtcore` appears in the IR of
#      `tests/alloc_probe.nv` at `--opt=0`, and none of them calls the
#      allocator, directly or through a runtime entry point that
#      allocates on the caller's behalf.
#   2. The scan still sees an allocation.  A heap list literal is
#      spliced into `clamp_high` on a copy of the tree, with that
#      function's `@tier(embedded)` taken off so the compiler is not
#      what refuses it, and the scan has to name it.  Without this run,
#      a scan that quietly stopped matching would pass forever.
#   3. The compiler still refuses the same splice with `@tier(embedded)`
#      left on.  An annotation that stopped being enforced looks exactly
#      like one that passes.
#
# Run from anywhere:  bash tests/alloc_scan.sh
